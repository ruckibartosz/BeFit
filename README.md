## About The Project
<p align="center">

</p>
BeFit is a free and open-source tool designed for tracking workouts at the gym. With this app, users can create custom training plans, view their statistics, and set specific goals.

The app's interface is user-friendly and allows users to easily input their workout data. Users can track their progress by recording their weight, sets, reps, and rest time. The app also includes a timer feature for rest intervals between sets.

One of the key features of the app is the ability to create custom workout plans tailored to the user's needs. Users can select exercises from a pre-existing database or add their own exercises to create a personalized plan. Once a plan is created, the app will track progress and provide recommendations for adjusting the plan based on the user's performance.

The app also includes a goal-setting feature where users can set specific targets for weight, reps, and sets. The app will track progress towards these goals and provide notifications when the user reaches a milestone.

In addition to tracking individual workouts, the app also provides users with an overview of their training history. Users can view their statistics, including total weight lifted, total sets completed, and total reps completed, over a specific time period.

This app is a great tool for gym-goers who want to track their progress and stay motivated. Its open-source nature allows for customization and potential contributions from the wider community.
